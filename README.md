## My process
  It took to have some basic knowledge of mark-ups and CSS. The main challenge for a newbie here was to make it responsive. I first applied the mark-ups needed and then did a little research to make it responsive. I used media queries to make it somewhat responsive
### Built with

- HTML 5 mark-ups
- CSS flexbox
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

Here I learned to use the media queries a little bit. I took help from chatGPT. Learning about the media query and how I can add break points for different screen sizes was a very good experience. I have trouble making the project responsive. But after a little research I could make it somewhat responsive.


### Continued development

I am looking into how I can make the project more responsive.


### Useful resources

- I have learnt the syntax and almost all other CSS properties used here from https://www.w3schools.com . It's really a nice platform to learn.
